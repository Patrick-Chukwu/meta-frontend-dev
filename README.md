## Overview
The course helps to kickstart a career in front-end development. It offers in-depth understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. The program not only equips you with knowledge to build interactive web pages, but also preps you for tech interviews with problem-solving strategies and portfolio-building projects.

My favourite part of the course was watching interviews by Software engineers from Meta, speaking on best practice, their experience and a whole lot of things.

## Programme objective
- Create a responsive website using HTML to structure content, CSS to handle visual style, and JavaScript to develop interactive experiences.
- Learn Bootstrap CSS Framework to create webpages and work with GitHub repositories and version control.
